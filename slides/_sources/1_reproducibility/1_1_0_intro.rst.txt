Why does reproducibility matter
===============================

.. slide:: Collaboration with future self
   :level: 3

    .. rst-class:: build

    - Working with last week's idea
    - Rescuing an old project
    - Re-running an analysis on new data

     :class: fill

.. slide:: Collaboration with others
   :level: 3

    .. rst-class:: build

    - Colleagues
    - Internal stakeholders
    - External peers

    .. figure:: /_static/1/solvay_conf.jpg
     :class: fill

   .. note:: Examples:
        Colleagues
        - Peer review
        - Learning from each other
        Stakeholders
        - Incorporating domain knowledge
        - Informing decision-making
        External peers
        - Academic partnerships
        - Meetups/working groups

Modes of collaboration
===================================

.. slide:: Modes of collaboration: Synchronous
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/1/feynman.jpg
     :class: fill

    .. rst-class:: build

      * Shared time (& often also space)
      * Interaction mostly one-way
      * Enables cognitive biases: Groupthink, Halo effect, Authority bias...

    .. note::

      Example: Someone presents project slides to a group during a meeting.
      Participants need to share time (and often space)
      Group typically tinkers with artifact (and presenter) and gives feedback
      - Requires lots of prep to be effective
      - Is limited to observation of the artifact (and the presenter)
      - Suffers from presenter bias


.. slide:: Modes of collaboration: Asynchronous
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/1/cathedral_bazaar.jpg
     :class: fill

    .. rst-class:: build

    - Distributed in time & space
    - Collaborators can tinker
    - Two-way interactions
    - Requires adequate tools

        This is a quote with `interpreted text`

    .. code-block:: python

        import sklearn
        a = 1 + 2

    .. note:: Example: open source projects
      Distributed in time and space
      Everybody has access to the development code and artifact in their own terms
      Group can tinker with everything and give feedback, which can be replied to also asynchronously
      Requires right collaboration tools
